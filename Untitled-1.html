<h1 style="text-align: center;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Report for final project</strong></span></h1>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Introduction:</strong></span></h3>

<p>In this report I will be discussing the details of my program and showing how I implemented them.</p>

<h3><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>The features implemented:</strong></span></h3>

<p>The features that I implemented in my project were all very unique and made the program even more enjoyable to use, I added features such as a RGB selector which had the purpose to make to the colour selection for the user much easier; as well as giving a much better variety&nbsp;for the number of colours in the program, as the user would have a much better selection to use from.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>I also used added a styling effect for my drawing pen as I made it &nbsp;a dotted line and thickness style stroke to the pen as an extra function. I also made a fill tool and an eraser function as well; in addition to this I made a draw shape function as well to give the user a greater experience.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>How I planned and coordinated development:</strong></span></h3>

<p>The way I planned with my partner to do this project was to have a time based set criteria; so essentially we would aim to do a task every four days. So essentially our plan was to finish the project three days before the deadline. We also allocated the easiest task to a day or so and made the harder task at some stretches up to seven days.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>How I structured my code:</strong></span></h3>

<p>My code was structured in a very simplistic manner and was essentially divided into various portion. So for example the rubber section of my program was divided into a portion and sectioned into the code where as the latter would also be divided to various sections. This structure helped me and my partner to coordinate it in a very effective manner.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Coding techniques used:</strong></span></h3>

<p>The coding techniques I used for my code were to make my code as simple and as easy to use. I organised my code in a way that enabled my partner to use the code and edit in an easy way. As it was very well organised and structured into blocks and paragraphs. I also used names that were easy to pick up in naming of paragraphs of the program and essentially made them very to use.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>challenges faced:</strong></span></h3>

<p>The problem faced in my project was the difficulty of implementing the rubber, as the rubber function would always erase unnecessary portions of the canvas and make it extremely difficult to use. The way I solved it was to make the radius of the rubber much smaller. This took time and eventually allowed my rubber to be much easier to use.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>what would you do differently next time:</strong></span></h3>

<p>Next time I would implement more advance features such as an inside memory library, I would also use a smart AI to build and make an assisted paint program feature. I would also use a mirroring function which would help magnify the drawings section of my program so that the user would be able to do pixel painting. This maybe could lead the user to do &nbsp;more advance graphic &nbsp;painting.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Also I would allocate more time to my future projects, so I can add more in-depth features.</p>
